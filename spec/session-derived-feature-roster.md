# Session-derived feature roster (2026-05-20 dev loop session)

Every directive the operator gave during the 2026-05-20 session must land as a real harness feature, not as ad-hoc behavior in the dev loop scaffolding. This document is the canonical checklist.

## Status legend

- ✅ Already in the harness (or scheduled in a queued/in-progress wave)
- 🚧 Specced, packet drafted, awaiting dispatch / merge
- 📋 To do — needs spec + packet + implementation

## Roster

| # | Feature | Origin directive | Target wave | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Full dev authority mode (auto-commit/push/dispatch) | "Override old rules, you have full dev authority" | Wave 7 | 🚧 | `--mode full_dev_authority` flag; `adapter.operator.mode` YAML key |
| 2 | L5-only escalation threshold | "Only request user input if face L5 error" | Wave 7 | 🚧 | `--escalation-threshold` flag |
| 3 | Never-globally-halt + auto-retry escalation model | "I don't want to need to manually re-arm" | Wave 6 (runtime) + Wave 7 (config) | 🚧 | manager.md prototype; productize in Wave 6 |
| 4 | Parallel supervisors with conflict-detection | "Supervisors should be able to run in parallel where possible" | Wave 6 | 📋 | Prototyped in manager.md; needs productization |
| 5 | Engine slot-filling (Kimi aggressive, DeepSeek on-demand) | "Don't let Kimi sit idle... DeepSeek can be idle" | Wave 6 + Wave 7 | 🚧 | `engine_slots` schema in state.json + CLI flags |
| 6 | Multi-Kimi parallelism via xaxiu-swarm swarm subcommand | "Swarm has the ability to deploy multiple API calls" | Wave 6 | 📋 | Loop manager wraps swarm subcommand; spec needed |
| 7 | swarm/kimi vs swarm/kimi-api distinction (agentic vs non-agentic) | "Refer to be able to differentiate kimi cli and kimi swarm" | Wave 6 | 📋 | Routing engine reads packet contract; selects backend accordingly. Memory `feedback_xaxiu_swarm_backend_agentic_differences` |
| 8 | Operator inputs → harness config | "All user guided input should be built into the harness... like --bare or --effort" | Wave 7 (foundation) + Wave 6 (extends) | 🚧 | Wave 7 packet queued — Kimi implementing now |
| 9 | When-uncertain → dispatch more Kimi alternatives | "For where you uncertain, you can deploy more kimi agents" | Wave 7 | 🚧 | `--explore-on-uncertainty dispatch_alternatives` flag |
| 10 | Event-driven loop ticks (cadence as floor) | "If a task is finished... do not wait for the 30 min countdown" | Wave 6 | 📋 | Loop runner reacts to task-completion events |
| 11 | All features into harness (this directive itself) | "All features guided by user is to be incorporated to the final harness" | Wave 6 (acceptance criterion) | 📋 | This roster IS the verification list |
| 12 | Autonomous dev loop pattern | "Create an autonomous loop to develop the harness" | Wave 6 | 📋 | Prototype lives in `coord/dev_loop/` — productize as `harness loop` verbs |
| 13 | Sub-loops + supervisor roles | "Treat claude sub agents as supervisors who control sub loops" | Wave 6 | 📋 | 4 supervisor roles in prototype; user picks engine per supervisor in adapter YAML |
| 14 | Observer system (workflow audit cycle) | "Arm observer for this session" | Wave 6 | 📋 | Cycle script + Task Scheduler registration |
| 15 | 24/7 persistent mode via Windows Task Scheduler | "Allow the harness to be functioning when you sleep" | Wave 4 (installer) + Wave 6 (runner) | 📋 | `bin/register-dev-loop-task.ps1` in prototype |
| 16 | Process-improvement loop (5th supervisor) | "Incorporate and deploy a process improvement loop for this session; findings to be incorporated in final harness as well" | Wave 6 | 🚧 | Prototype: `coord/dev_loop/supervisors/process_improvement.md`. Cadence 2h or trigger-driven (wave completion, repeated failures, L4/L5). Three tiers of findings: P1 inline, P2 packet, P3 memory/spec. First-tick findings on 2026-05-20 yielded this very row + 2 P1 fixes (parse-swarm-status integration + Kimi-CLI-incremental memory entry + 1200s timeout for multi-file packets). |
| 17 | Continuous heartbeat (operator passive status) | "Is dev manager up and active? Any loops idle" — operator shouldn't have to ASK | Wave 6 | 📋 | `harness heartbeat` CLI verb pulses to `coord/dev_loop/heartbeat.json` every N sec; `harness status` shows current loop activity in 1 second |
| 18 | "Dev manager doesn't idle either" rule | "There is nothing stopping you from planning next steps or doing something else when testing supervisor conducts their work" | Wave 6 (manager runtime) | 🚧 | manager.md "What you do NOT do" gains rules: supervisor return ≠ tick over, wakeup ≠ stop. The dev manager continues dispatching/drafting/planning while engines work. |
| 19 | **Canonical STATUS tracker as harness primitive** | "The status csv should be in the harness; it is our core feature to prevent session failures leading to corrupt chain" | **Wave 5.5 (dispatched-before-W5)** | 🚧 | Promotes `coord/STATUS.csv` from operator convention to `src/harness/status/` module + `harness status` CLI group. Pydantic-validated rows, atomic writes, dispatcher hooks (on_dispatch_start / on_dispatch_complete), mtime canary, schema-versioned. Packet at `coord/packets/2026-05-20-status-tracker-harness-feature/`. Highest-priority dispatch — the recovery layer for autonomous loops. Spec: `spec/status-tracker.md`. |

## Verification (Wave 6 acceptance criterion)

When Wave 6 is declared done, **every row above must be ✅**. Items still 🚧 or 📋 indicate Wave 6 isn't complete. The operator should be able to ship this roster to a fresh xaxiu-harness deployment and have all directives respected without re-asserting them.

This roster is the source of truth for Wave 6/7 acceptance — update it as features land.
